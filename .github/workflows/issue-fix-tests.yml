# CI for AI Debugger Benchmark
#
# This workflow runs the 7 tests in testing/test_issue_fixes.py that correspond
# to the 4 bugs described in ISSUES.md. All tests FAIL on the unpatched code.
# When your AI debugger fixes a bug, the corresponding test(s) should PASS.
#
# To run locally:
#   pip install -e .
#   python -m pytest testing/test_issue_fixes.py -v
